# Dummy Slot Project
This is a project for Super Smash Bros Ultimate to have new fighters by reusing characters already present in the game.

# What is it used for
This is to reslot characters slot based on where they are in the CSS (Character Select Screen).

#Example:

# Whats needed to get this done
- [x] Make the UI work
- [x] Make the game load the original character from the other UI
- [x] Set the color 1 to a different slot
- [ ] Set the color 1 to a different slot on the new UI and color 1 set to the original slot to the original character


#Notes:
Need to make the game find the ui_chara_"name" of the CSS slot

Reverse Engineering is need to make it happen.
